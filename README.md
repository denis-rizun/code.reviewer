# 🤖 Code.Reviewer — AI-Powered OSS Repo Auditor

This is an **AI-driven auditor** for open-source GitHub repositories.  
Built with **Go**, **Python**, **Kafka**, and a modular microservice architecture designed for high-throughput environments.


> ⚠️ **Project is currently in active development.** Features and architecture may evolve rapidly.

## 🚀 Project Goal

To create an intelligent assistant that audits public GitHub repositories and evaluates:  
- 📚 Documentation completeness
- 🧪 Test coverage
- ⚙️ CI/CD configurations
- 🧠 Code structure and complexity
- 🔍 Repository activity & contributor health
- 🔧 Improvement recommendations (TODOs)

## 📦 Architecture (detailed flow)

User  
- Interface Layer (Telegram Bot / Web UI)  
- `Go` API Gateway  
    - Validates repo URL  
    - Publishes task to Kafka topic  
- `Kafka` Broker  
    - Delivers tasks to processing workers  
- `Python` Analyzer  
    - Scans repo  
    - Runs static checks (AST, complexity, linters)  
    - Applies ML/NLP models (e.g., doc quality, commit-history health)  
    - Summarizes result as JSON & Markdown  
- `Go` API Gateway  
- User receives structured audit report
